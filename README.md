# Hi there, I’m Chase Miller

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a career transitioner and aspiring data analyst with a background in geology, hospitality, brewing, construction, and creative production.

After earning a B.S. in Classical Geology and researching volcanic systems in Northern California, I explored a range of hands-on industries—from building physical spaces and crafting cocktails to brewing kombucha and orchestrating large-scale events. Throughout it all, a consistent thread emerged: a love for structure, pattern recognition, and using observation to make sense of complexity.

That passion led me to complete the **TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Bootcamp**, where I built projects using SQL, Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and Python. This GitHub includes a mix of my bootcamp work and self-guided explorations as I continue to sharpen my technical skills.

### Current Projects

- **Smithsonian Volcano Index Analysis**  
  Cleaning, formatting, and analyzing global volcanic activity data in PostgreSQL, with a focus on eruption frequency by location and magma chemistry.  
  This ties back to my roots in geoscience and brings my experience full-circle.

- **Zomato Restaurant Dashboard Rebuild**  
  Re-visualizing my final bootcamp project in Tableau (originally built in Power BI) to compare user experience, storytelling clarity, and visual impact.

### Skills & Tools

- **Languages & Analysis**: SQL (PostgreSQL), Python, R (intro level)  
- **Visualization**: Tableau, Power BI  
- **Other Tools**: Excel, G Suite, Monday.com, Adobe Premiere, Ableton Live

### Outside the Dataset

When I’m not exploring data, I’m probably:
- Watching Premier League matches (Liverbird),
- Producing electronic music in Ableton Live,
- Painting or visiting Governors Island,
- Cooking something overly ambitious from scratch,
- Reading about world history, philosophy, or natural science.

### Let’s Connect!

If you're working on projects related to data analytics, science communication, or creative storytelling—or just want to swap music or recipe ideas—I’d love to chat.
